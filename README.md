# DynTable

This little table project is inspired by the .NET DataTable.
The idea was to create a dynamic, but (hopefully) memory-leak free, in-ram table.
Data is arranged in templated columns for type-safety and easier searchability.
Finding rows with certain values is supported via lambda-expressions.
